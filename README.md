This webapplication is based on Spring boot, so it can be started on command jar with java. Such like "java -jar myapplicatioin.jar". In the future, we can consider to deploy it to docker, as we have tool to deploy to docker easily. But this time I will not do this for saving time.

Besides, if development with Scala, code lines should be reduced greatly. Also not trying yet.  But you can refer to my similiar project: https://github.com/yuanqingfei/spring-jersey-angular-crud [https://github.com/yuanqingfei/spring-jersey-angular-crud]
